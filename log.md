# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 8, 2019
##### (back into code!)

**Today's Progress**: Started the freeCodeCamp curriculum again right from the very beginning after being dormant since 2017. This turned out to be a good thing because there were new lessons on HTML5 that I had a chance to complete!

**Thoughts:** Reviewing the very basics is never a bad idea. I've discovered that repetition is key to learning and retaining information!
