# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 8, 2019
##### (back into code!)

**Today's Progress**: Started the freeCodeCamp curriculum again right from the very beginning after being dormant since 2017. This turned out to be a good thing because there were new lessons on HTML5 that I had a chance to complete!

**Thoughts:** Reviewing the very basics is never a bad idea. I've discovered that repetition is key to learning and retaining information!

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some CSS on freeCodeCamp today. Can't wait to get more done!

**Thoughts:** I really wish I had more free time to work on coding projects. I think making a steady habit for 100 days is certainly moving in the right direction.

**Today's Progress**: I'm now halfway through the Applied Visual Design section on freeCodeCamp. The additional color theory knowledge is pretty interesting.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying seeing my contributions fill in each day, both on GitHub and on freeCodeCamp. It's a great motivator!

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Visual Design section on freeCodeCamp today and learned a whole lot about amazing ways to animate using just CSS. Mind officially blown!

**Thoughts:** Code is incredible and so fascinating. I'm glad to be picking up new knowledge each day I work on this.

#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section on freeCodeCamp today!

**Thoughts:** There is so much that I didn't already know and didn't take into consideration regarding accessibility. This particular topic has really opened my eyes.
